# Changelog

Changes in each release of rpg_vox, scribe, agent and Scribe for
Android. New entries go under **Unreleased**; `just publish` names that
section after the version it releases.

## Unreleased

## v0.1.2 (2026-10-08)

### Scribe for Android

- **Keep audio.** A Recording setting saves each recording (.opus) with
  its transcript. Tap any word to play from there: the words light up as
  they're spoken and the transcript follows along.
- **Playback controls:** back and ahead 10 seconds, pause and resume
  (also by tapping the transcript), and stop. They're in the
  notification and on the lock screen too, and playback pauses for calls
  and when headphones are unplugged.
- A thread plays straight through all its recordings, with a play button
  above each one; long-press it to delete that recording.
- **Keep non-speech audio** (off by default): recordings in which no
  words were heard are kept and shown as "No words detected". With it
  off, they're deleted, and playback shortens quiet between words to one
  second.
- **Edit and Cut** in the text selection menu: retype a paragraph, or
  remove words along with their stretch of audio. Cut also works while
  recording.
- Paragraphs stay in the order they were said, even when one is
  finished after a later one.
- Transcribing a file shows how far it has got and the time left.
- Settings are split into Microphone, Recording, Keyboard and Display
  (font size) pages, plus an About page with this changelog.
- Clear asks first, and Rename opens with the keyboard up.
- The ¶ button is gone; paragraphs break on pauses.
- Install and update with [Obtainium](ANDROID.md#install).

## v0.1.1 (2026-10-07)

### Scribe for Android

- First release: live transcription on the phone with the same models
  as scribe, from the mic, other apps' audio, or both; shared audio and
  video files; threads; Bluetooth headset mics and mic boost; recording
  in the background; and a voice typing keyboard. The APK is attached to
  each release.

### scribe

- Spoken digit strings are written as numerals.
- `scribe --chat` talks with an LLM through the new agent, with
  conversations kept as threads.
- An Android arm64 build of the command-line scribe (`just android`).

## v0.1.0 (2026-10-05)

- First release: scribe for macOS and Linux, and rpg_vox for Linux.
